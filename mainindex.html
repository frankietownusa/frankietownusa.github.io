                                videos, articles, etc. and let me know what you make on my <a href="www.twitter.com/frankietownusa" target="_blank">Twitter</a> so I can 
                                enjoy it too :) My work is very ugly, but functional.

                            <p>I feel like this is an eternal work in progress that I want to keep updating to document the path of the Chicago Cubs' 2022 draft class.
                            So, like everything on this list, I'm always still working on it. I broke each pick down by location, made some pie charts showing different
                            demographics in the class, and then have a chart with basic info and links to more information about each guy. You can find that project

                            <p>I made this recently for fun, and it is still under construction. It might lead to further research down the line, but for now, it is a 
                                (half-complete, but will be finished soon) fun app that visualizes some data that I don't think was supposed to be visualized. Still, it 
                                has been a really fun project and something that I am proud of. You can find this project <a href="winsmap/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>!

                            <p>This is a work in progress that I started for fun. I'm still working on it, so check back frequently for progress. I'm very proud of how
                                it is turning out so far! I made it using Leaflet's choropleth tutorial, and hope to flesh it out a bit more with some more data 
                                visualizations using more maps, or maybe some D3 graphs and charts, as well as adding Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario, as a
